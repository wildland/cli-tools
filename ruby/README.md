# Ruby Tools.

## TL;DR
First run `bundle install`

Then run whatever tool you want using `ruby <tool-name>.rb`. Example: `ruby sync-github-issue-labels.rb`.

## Avaliable Tools:
- `sync-github-issue-labels` Syncs all issue labels across repositories in an organization or user by making them all match a model repositoy.
- `find-open-pull-requests` Finds all open pull requests across repositories in an organization or user. This supports two-factor authentication.
